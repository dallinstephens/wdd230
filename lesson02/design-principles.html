            <p>The online store for The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-Day Saints is a great example of using Hick's
                Law. The choices are simple with just a few selections. This makes it easy for the user to decide on
                what to choose. For example, the women's clothing choices are put into easy selections: women's
                clothing, women's garments, women's ceremonial clothing, and women's white clothing.</p>

            <p>The online store Amazon is a great example of the design principle of repetion. Blocks that have
                different categories of products are repeated.</p>

            <p>The online store Jackman Music is a good example of Fitt's Law. The product images and YouTube buttons
                help illustrate Fitt's Law. The product images are large and easily clickable which takes the user to
                the
                product page. The YouTube buttons are large and and display a video to the user when clicked. The
                product images and YouTube buttons are close in proximity and large which helps illustrate the design
                principle Fitt's Law.</p>
